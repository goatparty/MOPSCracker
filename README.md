# MOPSCracker

Generates gold success codes for Physics Classroom's Minds of Physics lesson modules. Inspired by @cernec1999's ideas. Decompiled and reconstructed hashing algorithm with parameters from the Android version's APK. Algorithms were found written in Livecode, a really interesting English-like language, which happened to have a server version and Heroku buildpack! Built a nice Material web interface and a REST API. The Physics Classroom has been notified and is working to secure+change their algorithms. Never trust the client, folks!
